# PC Build Guide Project Instructions

This is a comprehensive PC component selection and build guide project focused on the Indian hardware market.

## Project Context
- **Target Audience**: Indian PC builders and enthusiasts
- **Scope**: Complete component analysis from basics to advanced topics
- **Market Focus**: Indian hardware availability, pricing, and warranties
- **Technical Depth**: From beginner explanations to expert-level component analysis

## Key Components to Cover
1. **Motherboards**: Sockets, chipsets, PCIe lanes, VRM analysis
2. **Processors**: Intel/AMD comparison, naming schemes, performance analysis
3. **Graphics Cards**: GPU architectures, memory types, power requirements
4. **Memory**: DDR4/DDR5, timings, capacity planning, overclocking
5. **Storage**: SSD/HDD, interfaces, performance metrics, endurance
6. **Power Supplies**: Wattage calculation, efficiency, modular design
7. **Cases**: Airflow, compatibility, build quality assessment
8. **Cooling**: Air/liquid cooling, TDP ratings, noise considerations
9. **Peripherals**: Monitors, keyboards, mice, audio equipment

## Technical Implementation Guidelines
